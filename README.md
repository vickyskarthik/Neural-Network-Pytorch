# Neural-Network-Pytorch
Repo to serve as tutorial for Neural Network Implementation using PyTorch

The various layers that make up any neural network are documented, [here.](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html)

The conv_layer_visualization notebook can be used to understand the CNN Layer and its working. (source)[https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893]
