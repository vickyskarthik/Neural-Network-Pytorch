# Neural-Network-Pytorch
Repo to serve as tutorial for Neural Network Implementation using PyTorch

The various layers that make up any neural network are documented, [here.](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html)

The conv_layer_visualization notebook can be used to understand the CNN Layer and its working. [source](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893)

Please also checkout the[linked, exercise repo](https://github.com/udacity/CVND_Exercises/tree/master/1_5_CNN_Layers) for multiple solutions to the following training challenge!
